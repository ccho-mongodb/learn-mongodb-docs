<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  The official MongoDB Node.js driver provides both callback-based
  and Promise-based interaction with MongoDB, allowing applications to
  take full advantage of the new features in ES6. The 2.x series of the
  driver is powered by a brand new core driver and BSON library.
